# Streaming-Finance-Data-with-AWS-Lambda

In this project, I provisioned two Lambda functions to generate near real time finance data records 
for downstream processing and interactive querying. 

I collect one full day’s worth of stock HIGH and LOW prices for each company listed below on Thursday, May 14th 2020, at an one minute interval

●	Facebook (FB)
●	Shopify (SHOP)
●	Beyond Meat (BYND)
●	Netflix (NFLX)
●	Pinterest (PINS)
●	Square (SQ)
●	The Trade Desk (TTD)
●	Okta (OKTA)
●	Snap (SNAP)
●	Datadog (DDOG)

This repo includes:

Lambda Source Code For DataCollector
Lambda function file data_collector.py
S3 Content From DataTransformer
CSV Output From Query in DataAnalyzer
